This is a utility for setting up a VPS, written as an exercise to practice and learn Go. At the same time I was learning about the SCP protocol and how to configure Nginx to serve an ASP.NET MVC site.

Note, **do not attempt to run this code**, as it only works for my machine and setup. Do not judge it too harshly as it was my first attempt at Go, and is almost certainly poor Go and heavily influenced by my C# background. I would more than welcome feedback from seasoned Gophers about how to better structure the code.
